The doctor has surgery. I called and confirm the appointment a day before the doctor doesn’t have any surgery. No doctor would have surgery an hour before my appointment so talking to this clinic is stuck in to target. It’s not professional at all. They’re very rude. Even the customer service is very rude.

3,50,google,google_50_1456942023,Joe M,1.0,"This is the absolute worst medical clinic my wife and I have ever visited.  Never have I felt so much frustration with the lack safety and oversight that should go into well established medical procedures.  The entire staff, from the receptionists to the nurses and doctors, do not take any responsibility for proper patient care or doing their job as anyone would expect.

My wife was at high risk to develop a dangerous syndrome when she was undergoing treatment for ivf.  She was at high risk because of something in her medical history, which the doctor knew, and yet the doctor never discussed the possibility of developing the syndrome with us at any real length.  No changes were made in her treatment regimen to help prevent developing this syndrome (which could have been done).  Unfortunately, after egg retrieval she started to feel sick and we called the clinic.  The first day, the doctor told us to ignore what she was feeling and that is was normal.  The doctor didn't follow-up in any way after that.  On the third day, my wife was very sick and she called and talked to a nurse, telling her how badly she felt, and the nurse said the doctor would call her back.  She didn't get a call back, so she e-mailed the online chart the doctor could see, and still got no response.  She then called a couple more times, and the receptionist kept putting her through to nurses voice mails.  I called, told the receptionist it was an emergency, and she put me through the same channels, straight to nurses voice mail.  I called again, said I needed to speak with any doctor, it was absolute emergency!  She put me through to another voice mail.  No one ever told us to go to the emergency room, but luckily we did so anyway.

We took my wife to the hospital where she had to have emergency surgery.  The ER doctors tried to call our doctor at the fertility clinic and said they couldn't get a hold of anyone (though our fertility doctor later told us he spoke with them, which they refute).  My wife was in the hospital for 4 days.  Even though our clinic doctor said he had talked to the ER doctors, he never once made any attempt to contact us after the emergency.

The people at this clinic want to take no responsibility for patient care.  If you call them, you can expect to wait the entire day for them to call you back (even in the case of an emergency).  Even still they may never contact you back.  They clearly do not care even the least bit about you or maybe they would check up to see how you are doing after an emergency which they supposedly knew about.

I cannot stress enough how miserable this experience has been (and this was over a month ago).  Please, if you are looking for a place for fertility treatment and care, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.

The one recommended to us had an out of pocket expense which is understandable however the office fee was between $150 to $450 plus $98 for the exam we asked for. We Googled another Urgent Care because they were unable to tell us how much the fee would be before we went ahead with the visit and we could not reconcile not knowing the cost because after all $150 to $450 plus the $98 was inconceivable. That’s when we Google searched and found Midwest Express Clinic. I spoke with Shantiniece who was super sweet and she was able to give me the exact price for the office visit plus the price for the exam we requested which was  basically 75% less than what we were quoted from the other urgent care place. Our Uber dropped us off at the incorrect location and I contacted Midwest Express again and spoke with Charysse was super sweet too and I was able to plug in the correct address for Midwest Urgent Care. From arrival we were treated so wonderfully. We felt valued and the place was clean as well as sanitary. We wore our masks and were see so expeditiously. We booked another appointment on the spot to get another exam and we were seen super quickly. Feride was amazing as was Charysse and our Provider Natalie Sanchez was phenomenal!

14,52,google,google_52_1636598301,Maddi Gelsinon,5.0,"I have received hands down the absolute best medical care with One Medical. While it is a concierge doctor's office (meaning there's a membership fee annually) it is truly very reasonable (~$200, but there may be coupons available for your first year if you know another member!) and they accept my insurance so it's otherwise the same cost or cheaper than getting medical coverage elsewhere.

I love that they have a very easy to use and intuitive app where I can schedule all my appointments, send messages to my medical care team, and get immediate video care for urgent matters. Beyond that, they have everything integrated - with COVID testing, a lab for blood work, vaccines, flu shots, etc. right in the office, and they have women's health experts as well. My full wellbeing is taken into account and they look at issues holistically - with physical and mental health both equally considered and addressed.

For members, they also have same day appointments available, which are amazing if you're feeling under the weather - and you can do these in person or virtually, depending on what makes sense with your schedule.

The staff are the absolute best. I've been able to forge strong relationships with my primary care doctor and the receptionist at the front is stellar - she is great at remembering me and following up with chit chat from my last visits.

When my grandparents describe the close, small town relationships they used to have with their doctors, nurses and other professionals at the doctors office, that's what I always wished I could have, but thought was a relic of times past. However, now that I'm a member of One Medical, I realize that this is what health care should be. Fully integrated, top notch health care professionals, and people who care - about you as a whole person, your full health.

Reception and then management confirmed the amount must be wrong because it is insanely high for two appointments, but no one, not even management, has actually provided me any information about why I’m being billed that much. Management has apologized and said it’s “their mistake” and they'll look into the discrepancy, but has been uncommunicative and failed to reply to my last few emails.

20,53,google,google_53_1759955611,Julie L.,1.0,"Update (As of 10/8/2025):

Between the time I placed my original review and August 22, 2025, I was made to go back and forth with someone named Toni in their billing office. On 8/13/25 I asked them to confirm they would remove charges from my account. I received no response until 8/22/25.

On 8/22/2025, it finally seemed like we were getting somewhere with a text that read:  ""Yes, we are removing all charges from your account and also offering you 3 months of your [prescription] refills for when you need it!""

Since receiving that text message, by 9/16/25, I had received two additional text messages from a different number ""reminding"" me of my unpaid balance. I sent a text requesting clarification and received none. As of yesterday, I've also received two additional physical copies of the bill by mail. So, on 10/7/25, I replied again via text, requesting that they stop contacting me and clear up the issue in their system and they have yet to respond. What a circus!

Original Review (August 12, 2025):
I was charged $323.61 for them to transfer an existing prescription from Walgreens to CVS. It only took 2-3 weeks of back and forth calls with the office to actually get that very simple task accomplished. Then came the unexpected bill in the mail. What a joke.

I will say that the actual practitioners I have seen at the clinic were all top tier. Very sad that their billing and other business practices do not reflect the same standards. After this experience, I am highly unlikely to return.",2025-10-08 15:33:31,,,2025-12-25 02:25:21.284932

The closest one was 30 minutes away. Both pharmacist at Mariano’s and cvs asked why this specific one was prescribed since there are others readily available such as cefdinir, cephalexin, or amox-clav. Wednesday when we went to go pick it up the price was around $150 for 7 day antibiotic and I asked if that’s with insurance they said yes and that the other antibiotics would be much cheaper. My husband called Midwest clinic if a new prescription could be given or if this is the only antibiotic that’s recommended the person said she will send a note to the physician we saw last night, after two hours or waiting for a call I called again. She said Jamie hasn’t responded and she’s not in. I asked if another physician can send over a prescription so we can get our two year old meds she said if we wanted another physician from the clinic to send a prescription we’d need to bring our daughter back to the clinic to get examined by the other doctor and get prescription. I couldn’t believe they would have us bring in our daughter again with 24hours. I told the nurse that’s ridiculous why would we need to go in again and pay another visit to get a prescription that’s more common and readily available she replied with we have insurance we can afford it.

It came back as not a break, but a ""slight separation.""  What?!?  So, we left with an inconclusive diagnosis.  But it gets better... They charged us the $175 that day which I put on our credit card, which was consistent with what they shared prior.

That day I thought I had signed for the credit card authorization of that day's service, but a month later, sure enough our credit card was automatically charged another $96.43, but from a ""Wellnow Urgent Care.""  Then, another month thereafter, we got another auto-charge for $96.43 (for a total of $192.86 of additional charges) from the same company.

When I handed off the paper work to the physician they said they would fill it out when the results were complete (about 3 days) and I would be able to pick it up in a few days. Before leaving, I confirmed again with the front desk that I would be able to receive the same form I came in with when my results are complete. Before leaving, I also asked the front desk how I would know when my results were complete and she handed me a QR code that later when I tried to scan - did not work. I went to the website and set up an account to view my results days later, since I had not heard back from anyone, and didn't see any results or tests pending in my account. On my end, there was no proof that I had been seen or had any labs drawn that day besides the bruise on my arm. I called the clinic and asked about my results and the document I brought in to be filled out and there was no record of it and a level of confusion. The receptionist let me know my lab results were processed and she had them emailed to me as an encrypted zip file that was password protected without clear instruction on how to view. How was I supposed to know they were complete or view them if I had not called and asked for this unofficial encrypted email? Regardless, I need the paperwork to submit to my employer. The receptionist said she would send a message to the provider about the form. The next morning I called again inquiring about the form and again no recollection or documentation of my previous conversation. I tell her if they have misplaced the form that is fine and I will redeliver it on my lunch because it's time sensitive. I verify that if I came in with the form, they would be able to fill it out at that time and I could take it with me. She said yes. So I commuted over there and left with nothing because the provider was not there. They would have to send the provider a message and wait. At this point it has been 7 days since I was first seen. Obviously frustrated, I ask how I will be able to receive the document when I leave here, since I can't see anything in the ""patient portal"". The woman I spoke to had an attitude and kept reexplaining to me that the provider was not here and she couldn't sign for it. I understood that. My question was about HOW I will receive the form when it is completed since there seems to be no record of it anywhere. She finally tells me after going back and forth that they will have to email it to me. I then ask if I will have to call to have them email it to me and she says probably..

At the time of the call, I explained that I had had all the necessary testing done just 6 weeks prior. I was instructed to keep the appt at the pre-op clinic as the prior testing was done outside required time constraints. Well....once I got to my appt, and after the nurse reviewed my records, she said I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD to come in as the prior testing was sufficient. After checking my blood pressure, I was dismissed.
That blood pressure check cost $438!!!! My insurance won't pay as the visit was coded as ""General Classification"".  After several calls, and months of frustration, no one at Northwestern can explain why my visit was coded as such and why the fee was incongruous with the service.",2016-07-15 14:31:21,,,2025-12-25 04:32:04.062448

There was absolutely no one in the place besides me. Then they found the ear wax was not coming out and needed to be softened, they said I should do this at home and they can’t do it there cause everyone is itching to get home!!! There was still 15 -20 min before closing time!! I left with my ear even more blocked due to the irrigation, my insurance charged for nothing and the asked to just do this by myself at home.
Left very disappointed. I don’t even know what the staff was doing this whole time I was there since there was absolutely no one else in the place but me",2025-12-02 22:46:21,,,2025-12-27 01:07:48.272222
